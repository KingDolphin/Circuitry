# Welcome to OpenCircuits!

I wanted to create this document to define the inputs electrical components used OpenCircuits. This document will the components used in the side-bar.

# Constant Low
A constant low means that power is constantly not suppled

# Constant High
A constant low means that power is constantly supplied

# Button
A push-button switch is a small, sealed mechanism that completes an electric circuit when you press on it. When it's on, a small metal spring inside makes contact with two wires, allowing electricity to flow. When it's off, the spring retracts, contact is interrupted, and current won't flow.

# Switch
In electrical engineering, a switch is an electrical component that can disconnect or connect the conducting path in an electrical circuit, interrupting the electric current or diverting it from one conductor to another.

# Clock
In electronics and especially synchronous digital circuits, a clock signal (historically also known as logic beat) oscillates between a high and a low state and is used like a metronome to coordinate actions of digital circuits. A clock signal is produced by a clock generator.
