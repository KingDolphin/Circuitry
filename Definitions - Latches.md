# Welcome to OpenCircuits!
I wanted to create this document to define the latches electrical components used OpenCircuits. 

# D
The D latch is used to capture, or 'latch' the logic level which is present on the Data line when the clock input is high. When the CLK input falls to logic 0, the last state of the D input is trapped and held in the latch

# SR
An SR latch made from two NAND gates. An SR latch (Set/Reset) is an asynchronous device: it works independently of control signals and relies only on the state of the S and R inputs.
