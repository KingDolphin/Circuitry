# Buffer
A digital buffer (or a voltage buffer) is an electronic circuit element that is used to isolate the input from the output, providing either no voltage or a voltage that is same as the input voltage. It draws very little current and will not disturb the original circuit.

# NOT
Inverts value: True if input is False; False if input is True

# AND
True if A and B are both True

#NAND
AND followed by NOT: False only if A and B are both True

#OR
True if either A or B are True

#NOR
OR followed by NOT: True only if A and B are both False

#XOR
True if either A or B are True, but False if both are True

#XNOR
XOR followed by NOT: True if A and B are both True or both False
